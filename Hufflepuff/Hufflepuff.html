            <h2>Traits
            </h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Loyalty</h3>
                    <p>Hufflepuffs make the most loyal friends a person can find. They also identify strongly with their House, as seen in The Goblet of Fire where the majority of Hufflepuffs turn against Harry because they think he's trying to undermine one of their own, Cedric Diggory</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Dedication</h3>
                    <p>Hufflepuffs are some of the most hard-working students and employees in the Wizarding World. While they may not have a Ravenclaw's natural love of learning and knowledge or a Slytherin's cunning and ambition, Hufflepuffs try their hardest in everything they do... and are rewarded for it.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Honesty</h3>
                    <p>Hufflepuffs feel a strong desire to speak the truth and behave honestly in everything that they do. Gryffindors also value this trait, which is part of what makes Hufflepuff-Gryffindor friendships so strong.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Humbleness</h3>
                    <p>Unlike the other houses, which are all prone to arrogance, Hufflepuffs almost never display this trait. They are modest and humble in everything that they do and tend to stay away from those who exude self-importance.</p>

            <h2>Helga Hufflepuff</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Helga Hufflepuff (fl. c. 993) was a Welsh witch and was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. While the other founders chose to have special students, she accepted them all without preference, but the students of her house are described as loyal and hard-working. Helga's portrait remained at Hogwarts by at least the 1980s.</p>
