            <h2>Traits
            </h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Courage</h3>
                    <p><p>The Gryffindor house emphasised the traits of courage as well as "daring, nerve, and chivalry and
                        thus its members were generally regarded as brave, though sometimes to the point of
                        recklessness. Some Gryffindors had also been noted to be short-tempered. Notably, Gryffindor
                        house contributed many members to Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix,although this
                        may have been because the main members made it a point not to associate with other houses.</p></p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Burning Desire</h3>
                    <p>Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason that the
                        colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house.The colour of fire corresponded
                        to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the
                        coat. </p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Oppurtunist</h3>
                    <p> They take every oppurtunity and try to make best out of it . Because of this nature members of
                        other houses, particularly Slytherin, sometimes felt that Gryffindors engaged in "pointless
                        heroics".</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Determination</h3>
                    <p>Like Hufflepuffs, Gryffindor are highly determined. Their determination, however, is more
                        self-focused. They will use their strong work ethic to fulfill their ambition and advance their
                        own position. While this may seem self-absorbed, Slytherins recognise that by focusing on
                        self-improvement, they can become better friends and family members and be more useful to
                        society as a whole.</p>

            <h2>Godric Gryffindor
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Professor Godric Gryffindor was a wizard of medieval times and one of the four Founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was good friends with Salazar Slytherin but opposed him when he later thought that they should not accept Muggle-born students at Hogwarts. It is unknown when he died. Gryffindor's birthplace became known as Godric's Hollow, in his honour. Godric Gryffindor's portrait still remains at Hogwarts.</p>
