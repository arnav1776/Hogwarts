                    <p>Ravenclaws are often hard-working and diligent, as often was the case with intellectuals with a
                        predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle were known
                        to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of satisfying their own
                        intellectual curiosity.</p>

            <h2>Rowena Ravenclaw
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Rowena Ravenclaw (fl. c. 993 – 1000) was a Scottish witch. Noted for her intelligence and creativity and regarded as one of the greatest witches of the age, Ravenclaw was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, as well as the namesake of the Ravenclaw House. Ravenclaw was "beautiful yet slightly intimidating."

                Ravenclaw died sometime in the eleventh century, after she fell fatally ill. Legend had it that a broken heart is the cause — because her daughter Helena ran away with her diadem. Rowena's portrait remains at Hogwarts.</p>
