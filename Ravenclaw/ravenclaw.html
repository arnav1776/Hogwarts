                    <h3>Wisdom</h3>
                    <p>Ravenclaw House prized learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members.[6] Thus, many
                        Ravenclaws tended to be academically motivated and talented students.</p>

                    <h3>Hard Working</h3>
                    <p>Ravenclaws are often hard-working and diligent, as often was the case with intellectuals with a
                        predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle were known
                        to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of satisfying their own
                        intellectual curiosity.</p>

                    <p>Ravenclaws tended to be curious about the world and paid attention to the world around them.
                        Ravenclaws were known to be logical and rational. In addition, Ravenclaw students tended to have
                        abilities regarding Memory.</p>

                    <p>Ravenclaw students tended to have abilities regarding Memory. Garrick Ollivander, for example,
                        possessed an eidetic memory and can remember every wand he has sold,[21] and Gilderoy Lockhart
                        had an exceptional talent in the Memory Charm.</p>

            <h2>Rowena Ravenclaw
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Rowena Ravenclaw (fl. c. 993 – 1000) was a Scottish witch. Noted for her intelligence and creativity and regarded as one of the greatest witches of the age, Ravenclaw was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, as well as the namesake of the Ravenclaw House. Ravenclaw was "beautiful yet slightly intimidating."

                Ravenclaw died sometime in the eleventh century, after she fell fatally ill. Legend had it that a broken heart is the cause — because her daughter Helena ran away with her diadem. Rowena's portrait remains at Hogwarts.</p>

                    was widely considered the best wandmaker in the world, and many wizards and witches bought 
                    their wands from him.</p>
