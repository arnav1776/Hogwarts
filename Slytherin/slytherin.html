            <h2>Traits</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Ambition</h3>
                    <p>A trait that nearly all Slytherins have in common is ambition. They want to be the best: the
                        smartest in the class, the most popular in a group of friends, the boss at work. Because of
                        their strong drive and work ethic, they often achieve these heights, too, becoming invaluable
                        members of society and powerful in the work world.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Cunning</h3>
                    <p>Slytherins are highly intelligent, but not in the same way as Ravenclaws. Rather than seeking to
                        expand their knowledge, Slytherins simply find ways to use their existing skills to their
                        advantage. This makes them clever and cunning and can aid them in their quest for fame and
                        power.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Resourcefulness</h3>
                    <p>Slytherins are able to make the best of any situation. They're highly adaptable and resourceful
                        and can find ways to turn even the worst situations to their advantage.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Determination</h3>
                    <p>Like Hufflepuffs, Slytherins are highly determined. Their determination, however, is more
                        self-focused. They will use their strong work ethic to fulfill their ambition and advance their
                        own position. While this may seem self-absorbed, Slytherins recognise that by focusing on
                        self-improvement, they can become better friends and family members and be more useful to
                        society as a whole.</p>

            <h2>Salazar Slytherin</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Salazar Slytherin (fl. c. 993) was a pure-blood wizard, noted for his cunning and determination. He was
                regarded as one of the greatest wizards of the age, respectively as a Parselmouth and as a skilled
                Legilimens. Slytherin was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along
                with Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff and Rowena Ravenclaw, as well as the namesake of the Slytherin
