            <h2>Traits
            </h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Ambition</h3>
                    <p>A trait that nearly all Slytherins have in common is ambition. They want to be the best: the
                        smartest in the class, the most popular in a group of friends, the boss at work. Because of
                        their strong drive and work ethic, they often achieve these heights, too, becoming invaluable
                        members of society and powerful in the work world.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Cunning</h3>
                    <p>Slytherins are highly intelligent, but not in the same way as Ravenclaws. Rather than seeking to
                        expand their knowledge, Slytherins simply find ways to use their existing skills to their
                        advantage. This makes them clever and cunning and can aid them in their quest for fame and
                        power.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Resourcefulness</h3>
                    <p>Slytherins are able to make the best of any situation. They're highly adaptable and resourceful
                        and can find ways to turn even the worst situations to their advantage.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Determination</h3>
                    <p>Like Hufflepuffs, Slytherins are highly determined. Their determination, however, is more
                        self-focused. They will use their strong work ethic to fulfill their ambition and advance their
                        own position. While this may seem self-absorbed, Slytherins recognise that by focusing on
                        self-improvement, they can become better friends and family members and be more useful to
                        society as a whole.</p>

                <h2>Salazar Slytherin

                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>Professor Salazar Slytherin was a pure-blood wizard of medieval times. He was a Parselmouth (a wizard
                    with the rare ability to speak with snakes) and skilled at Legilimency.He was one of the four
                    founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the former best friend of Godric
                    Gryffindor, a fellow founder. Slytherin didn't trust Muggle-born students, and he expressed his
                    opinion not to accept them at Hogwarts. However, when the other Hogwarts founders didn't agree,
                    Slytherin left the school and did not return again but not before creating the Chamber of Secrets
                    and concealing a basilisk inside. He died sometime in the Middle Ages.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Draco Lucius Malfoy(b. 5 June 1980) was a British pure-blood wizard and the only son of Lucius
                    and Narcissa Malfoy(n√©e Black). The son of a Death Eater, Draco was raised to strongly believe in
                    the importance of blood purity. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from
                    1991-1998 and was sorted into Slytherin House. During his years at Hogwarts, he became friends with
                    Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, and other fellow Slytherins, but he quickly
                    developed a rivalry with Harry Potter.</p>

                <h2>Merlin</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Merlin was a legendary British wizard who lived during the Middle Ages. Little is known of his past,
                    but he was a member of King Arthur's court, and arguably the most famous wizard of all time. <br>
                    Merlin was born sometime during the medieval era. During his formative years, he attended
                    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and was sorted into Slytherin House. It is possible
                    that he was taught by Salazar Slytherin himself, given the time period Merlin lived in. It is said
                    that Merlin's wand was of English oak (though his grave has never been found, so this cannot be
                    proven).</p>

                <br>
                <p>Professor Horace Eugene Flaccus Slughorn (b. 28 April, between 1882 and 1913) was a
                    pure-blood or half-blood wizard. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as a
                    member of Slytherin before returning in 1931 as Potions Master. He also served as Head of Slytherin
                    House, before retiring in 1981 due to a fear that Albus Dumbledore would discover that he had told
                    Tom Riddle about Horcruxes.</p>
